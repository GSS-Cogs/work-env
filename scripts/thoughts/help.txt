name: How to use this tool

    * The underlying snippets tool is call brain (sorry not sorry) and each snippet is considered a 'thought'.
    * Each 'thought' is stored in the github repo as a txt file in `scripts/thoughts`
    * Each thought consists of:
        - space separated tags on line 1
        - a title on line 2
        - free text from line 3
    * Don't keep your good snippets locally, pr them into git (so everying gets them next time they 'sync').
    * You CAN extend with personal snippets via pointing to a local directory with the environment variable `MY_LOCAL_BRAIN_SNIPPETS`
    
Usage:
* Call without arguments (i.e cli brain) for a summary of all tags and item count per tag.
* Call with tags (i.e "cli brain tag1 tag2") to display relevant snippets. 

Note - text colour will alternate between blue and green per snippet to keep longer lists of snippets more readable.
